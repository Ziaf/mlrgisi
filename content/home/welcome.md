Our contributions as part of the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) can be broadly categorized into theoretical analysis and applications of Machine Learning. Our research articles regularly find their rightful places in top-tier venues such as AAAI, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, ICCV, NeurIPS, CVPR, AISTATS, etc. The impact of our publications is further evident by the 2000+ times they are cited over recent years.
